## fm3chanic Themes for Gnome Text Editor

This repository contains all color themes for the Gnome Text Editor I've created so far.<br> 
It is the text editor which comes with Gnome desktop environment for linux.

Themes which have been created during my project of color theming Vtubers are in the directory "vtuber_project". The directory "other" contains all color themes which where created outside of the project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that all color themes have been originally created for Notepad++, which has the tendency to show colors lighter as they are in other applications. Therefore it might occur that the color theme is a bit on the darker side.

### Installation:

Copy the theme file to `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-5/styles` and restart the application.<br>
The theme should now be selectable in your preferences.

> [!NOTE]
> It might be necessary to create the directory first as `/gtksourceview-5/styles` might be missing in `~/.local/share`.
> The editor doesn't allow light themes to be used in dark mode and vice versa. If a theme does not show up in preferences, you might need to switch to the opposite mode.

### Contribution:

If you want to help maintaining the themes, please use colors from the according color scheme. You can find the scheme files in the repo linked above.
